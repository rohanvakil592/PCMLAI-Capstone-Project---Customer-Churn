## Motivation
-	Purpose: Created to predict customer churn (account closures) for banks, enabling proactive retention strategies.
-	Creator: Unknown (uploaded to Kaggle by user Shantanu Dhakad). Likely synthetic/generated for educational purposes.
-	Funding: Unknown.

## Composition
-	Instances: Each row represents a bank customer with features like credit score, account balance, and demographics.
-	Count: 10,000 instances (customers).
o	Churn Rate: 20% (2,000 churned vs. 8,000 retained).
-	Missing Data: No missing values (clean synthetic dataset).
-	Confidential Data: None (no real identifiers like names or account numbers).

## Collection Process
-	Acquisition Method: Likely simulated/generated (not real-world data).
-	Sampling Strategy: Unknown (assumed random if synthetic).
-	Time Frame: Unknown.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling
-	Preprocessing:
o	Categorical variables (e.g., Geography, Gender) have been encoded.
o	No missing values or outliers reported.
-	Raw Data: Only the cleaned version is available (no "raw" data provided).
-	Removed variables “CustomerId”, “Surname” and “RowNumber” since they are not used descriptive for identifying customers and do not contain relevant information for the model.

## Uses
-	Potential Tasks:
o	Customer segmentation.
o	Lifetime value prediction.
o	Bias detection in banking services (e.g., by geography/gender).
-	Risks/Limitations:
o	Bias: Overrepresents French customers (50%) vs. Spain/Germany. Gender imbalance (55% Male).
o	Harm: Could perpetuate biases if used for loan approvals (not recommended).
-	Mitigations:
o	Balance classes (e.g., SMOTE for churn cases).
o	Audit model fairness (e.g., check performance by gender/region).
-	Not Recommended For: Credit scoring, loan approvals, or any high-stakes decisions.

-	IP/Copyright: None (free to use/modify).

Maintenance
